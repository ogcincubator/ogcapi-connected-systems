  description: |-
    List or search all `System` resources available from this server endpoint.

    By default, only top level systems are included (i.e. subsystems are ommitted) unless the `parent` query parameter is set.

  summary: Create new systems
  description: |-
    Add one or more new top-level `System` resources (i.e. these systems will have no parent).

    Note that it is possible to create multiple resources in a single batch request.
    In this case, several resource descriptions are provided in the content body inside a JSON array.
    On success, the server will send a `200` response with the list of URIs of all created resources,
    in the same order as the array in the request.

    If a client posts a new description of an existing system with a more recent validity period
    (i.e. starting after the validity period of the current description), the provided description
    will become the current one. In order for the server to identify the existing system, its local
    ID must be included in the payload using the `id` property. If system history is supported, the
    old description is also archived in the system history.
