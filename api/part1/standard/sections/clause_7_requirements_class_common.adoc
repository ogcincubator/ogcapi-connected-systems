== Requirements Class "Common"

=== Overview
include::../requirements/common/requirements_class_common.adoc[]

This requirements class regroups core dependencies that all other requirements class inherit.
It also provides clarifications on the use of the {ogcapi-common} Standard constructs.


=== API Landing Page

The landing page provides links to start exploration of the resources offered by an OGC API implementation instance. The {ogcapi-common} Standard already requires some common links, sufficient for this Standard.


=== API Definition

Every OGC API implementation instance is required to provide a definition document that describes the capabilities of that instance. This definition document can be used by developers to understand the API capabilities, by software clients to connect to the server, or by development tools to support the implementation of servers and clients.

Implementation must comply with requirements defined in the {ogcapi-common} Standard when generating the API definition document.


=== Collections

This CS API Standard defines several resource types that are intended to be offered by the server via separate collections. 

This CS API uses two types of collections:

  - Root Collections
  - OGC API - Common Resource Collections (or OGC API - Feature Collections)

==== Root Collections

The root collections are mandatory and have simple URLs located directly at the API root. They expose all resources of a given type hosted by the server, and provide a default endpoint for search queries that target these resources. Canonical resource URLs are based on the root collections URLs.

The root collections URLs for resource types defined in Part 1 of the CS API Standard are:

- `{api_root}/systems`
- `{api_root}/procedures`
- `{api_root}/deployments`
- `{api_root}/samplingFeatures`
- `{api_root}/properties`

The root collection for a given resource type is specified by the corresponding requirements class.

NOTE: GET operations at these root collections URLs will return a list of items directly, not the collection metadata object.

==== OGC API Common Collections

These resource collections are governed by requirements from {ogcapi-common-2} (and also from {ogcapi-features-1} for feature collections).

The CS API makes use of the collection mechanism specified in these two Standards to allow a server to provide a more organized view of its content, by grouping them into logical collections according to any criteria. Thus, a conformant OGC API Common collection endpoint provides a secondary way of getting to the resources that are already available through the root collections.

Note that a given resource can be made available through one or more OGC API Common collection endpoints (i.e. collections can overlap). This provides great flexibility for a server to organize resources according to multiple criteria and thus provide different view points to the client simultaneously. See the requirements classes of the different feature types for examples.

When exposing resources via an OGC API Common collection endpoint, the server must indicate the type of the items contained in the collection. This is done using the `itemType` attribute of the collection. For feature collections, the `itemType` is always set to `feature`, so this Standard defines the `featureType` attribute to further specify the type of features contained in the collection.  

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/api-common/collection-type

part:: A resource collection containing one of the feature types defined in this Standard SHALL be a valid feature collection as defined by {ogcapi-features-1}.

part:: A feature collection containing exactly one of the feature types defined in this Standard SHALL have a `featureType` attribute.

part:: If a collection is tagged with the `featureType` attribute, all items in the collection SHALL be resources of the specified type.
====

Heterogeneous feature collections (i.e. collections containing a mix of feature types) are allowed but this Standard does not define the behavior of such collections.

[permission,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /per/api-common/mixed-types-collection

The server CAN also offer collections containing mixed feature types. The behavior of these mixed collections in not defined by this Standard.
====


=== Links and Canonical URLs

Since resources defined by this Standard can be discovered through multiple collections, it is recommended to always link to a given resource using its canonical URL (e.g. it's primary URL, such as `{api_root}/systems/{id}`) instead of the collection based URL (e.g. `{api_root}/collections/my_system_collection/{id}`).

The canonical URL of a resource is based on the URL of the catch-all collection of the corresponding resource type. This leads to the following canonical URLs for resource types defined in this part of the Standard:

- `{api_root}/systems/{id}`
- `{api_root}/procedures/{id}`
- `{api_root}/deployments/{id}`
- `{api_root}/samplingFeatures/{id}`
- `{api_root}/properties/{id}`

When resources are retrieved from a URL that is not their canonical URL (e.g. when they are retrieved through their Feature Collection URL), a link with relation type `canonical` is included, as shown in the following example.

[recommendation,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/api-common/canonical-links

Any link to a resource whose type is specified by this Standard SHOULD use its canonical URL.
====


=== Resource IDs

Resource IDs are typically generated by the server and are not guaranteed to be globally unique.
However, the server must ensure that IDs are unique within a given resource type and/or feature type.

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/api-common/resource-ids

The server SHALL ensure that resource IDs are unique across all collections of a given resource type.
====


=== Unique Identifiers (UID)

This Standard mandates that some resource types (e.g. feature resources) have a globally unique identifier that is independent of the resource URL. This is needed to carry the identity of the real-world object that a resource represents across services, as multiple servers may host different representations/descriptions of the same object.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Example*

A Connected Systems API server implementation may hold the summary representation of a building, while the feature API server of the land register contains its 2D footprint, and the emergency response server contains its detailed 3D structure. All 3 representations should refer to the same identifier so they can be related to each other.
====

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/api-common/resource-uids

part:: The server SHALL ensure that resource UIDs (Unique IDs) are unique across all its collections.
====

[recommendation,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/api-common/resource-uids-types

part:: The server SHOULD ensure that resource UIDs are globally unique URIs, that is either:

- URNs for 128-bits Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID) (prefixed by `urn:uuid:`, see RFC4122)
- URNs using a namespace registered with IANA
====


=== Coordinate Reference Systems

As the CS API Standard extends {ogcapi-features-1}, the server is only required to implement support for `CRS:84` (longitude, latitude) and `CRS:84h` (longitude, latitude, height). However, if support for a CRS other than `CRS:84` or `CRS:84h` is needed, the server can also implement requirements from the {ogcapi-features-2} Standard.


=== Date/Time Query Parameter

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/api-common/datetime

part:: When the `datetime` query parameter is used to filter a collection of feature types defined in this Standard, the server SHALL use the `validTime` attribute of the features to determine their temporal extent.

part:: Only features with a `validTime` period that intersects the value of the `datetime` query parameter, or features that don't report any temporal validity (i.e. `validTime` attribute is `null` or not set), SHALL be included in the result set.
