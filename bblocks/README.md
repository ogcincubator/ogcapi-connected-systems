## OGC BuildingBlocks specification management overlay

This directory defines a CI/CT/CD overlay on the main repository to support automation of validation and generation of documentation artefacts.

Documentation includes:
- [browse view] (https://ogcincubator.github.io/ogcapi-connected-systems/)
- generation of summary reports on validations
- generation of a register of all components (in the form that will be used in the OGC Building Block Register)
- registering specification components and dependencies in OGC Knowledge Base ("RAINBOW")

## Refactoring

This overlay allows for regression testing as non-specific generic components are updated to use, or promoted to, reusable OGC Building Blocks.
