=== 3D Pose

This requirements class defines new data types for expressing 3D pose information in a more formal way within SensorML documents. It builds on the <<OGC-GeoPose,GeoPose Standard>> that was released after version 2.1 of SensorML.

When a 3D Pose object is used as the value of the `position` property within a SensorML `PhysicalComponent` or `PhysicalSystem` instance, it defines the pose of the local reference frame attached to the component (intrinsic reference frame), relative to an external reference frame (extrinsic reference frame).

=== GeoPose

The GeoPose Basic classes are used to define a pose relative to a tangent reference frame associated to the WGS84 ellipsoid. The location of the local tangent plane (LTP) is provided using EPSG:4979 coordinates and orientation is provided as yaw/pitch/roll angles or quaternion in the local tangent frame.

SensorML uses the link:https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-056r11/21-056r11.html#_requirements_for_standardization_target_1_basic_ypr[Basic-YPR] and link:https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-056r11/21-056r11.html#_requirements_for_standardization_target_2_basic_quaternion[Basic-Quaternion] classes defined in the <<OGC-GeoPose,GeoPose Standard>>.

These classes are used to define the pose of an object relatively to the earth ellipsoid.


=== Relative Pose

The Relative Pose classes `Relative_YPR` and `Relative_Quaternion` are modeled on their GeoPose counterparts, but in this case, both position and orientation are provided relative to a cartesian reference frame.

These classes are used to define the pose of an object relatively to another object (e.g. a sensor relative to its platform).
