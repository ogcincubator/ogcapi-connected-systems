==== AbstractPhysicalProcess

The schema for this abstract class is provided in {jsonschema-base-url}/AbstractPhysicalProcess.json[AbstractPhysicalProcess.json].

It is imported by the schemas of derived classes and thus does not need to be used directly for validation.



==== PhysicalComponent

The `PhysicalComponent.json` schema is the JSON schema implementation of the `PhysicalComponent` UML class defined in https://docs.ogc.org/is/12-000r2/12-000r2.html#47[clause 7.5] of <<OGC-SML>>.

identifier:: /req/json-physical-component/schema-valid

The JSON document instance shall be valid with respect to the JSON schema {jsonschema-base-url}/PhysicalComponent.json[“PhysicalComponent.json”].

The following snippet illustrates how a simple sensor instance can be described as a physical component with a fixed geographic location:

==== 3D Pose

The position of a physical component can also be specified by a 3D pose object as specified by the JSON schema {jsonschema-base-url}/Pose.json[Pose.json].
