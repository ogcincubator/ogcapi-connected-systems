==== PhysicalSystem

The `PhysicalSystem.json` schema is the JSON schema implementation of the `PhysicalSystem` UML class defined in https://docs.ogc.org/is/12-000r2/12-000r2.html#53[clause 7.6] of <<OGC-SML>>.

The JSON document instance shall be valid with respect to the JSON schema {jsonschema-base-url}/PhysicalSystem.json[“PhysicalSystem.json”].

The following snippet illustrates how the specifications (datasheet) of a complete weather station can be described as a physical system. In this example, each component of the system represents one of the sensors connected to the base station:

[source%unnumbered,json]

include::../schemas/json/examples/spec/physical_system_specs.json[lines="1,3..-1"]

NOTE: This inline example was abridged for clarity. You can see the full example {jsonschema-base-url}/examples/weather_station_system.json[here].

Below is another example describing a specific instance of the weather station, with specifications provided above. The instance refers to the datasheet using the `typeOf` property, and also provides contact information for the operator, as well as a fixed location:
